# Entity Relationships Implementation Plan

## 🎯 **Executive Summary**

This plan outlines the implementation of a comprehensive entity relationship system that transforms the current basic co-occurrence tracking into a rich, semantic relationship network capable of powering contextual intelligence for both cybersecurity and construction domains.

**Goal**: Enable context queries like "I'm at John's, add a 30 dollar charge for more screws" to automatically resolve to specific projects, locations, and billing contexts through intelligent relationship mapping.

## 📊 **Current State Analysis**

### **Existing Data Structure**
- **Entity Storage**: JSON files with structured categories (people, projects, materials, locations, etc.)
- **Relationships**: Basic merge pairs only (`entity_375deeb0|entity_7cdb2131`)
- **Domains**: cybersec (16 entities), construction (2 entities), misc (28 entities)
- **Context**: No semantic relationships, no temporal tracking, no spatial mapping

### **Data Quality Assessment**
- **Cybersec**: Rich professional role data, security tools, consulting projects
- **Construction**: Limited to property records (TCAD data), minimal project tracking
- **Relationships**: Co-occurrence only, no semantic meaning or directionality

### **Integration Points**
- **Construction Data**: TCAD property records, client project files in `/snappy/client-projects/`
- **Cybersec Data**: Professional roles, security tools, assessment methodologies
- **Temporal Data**: Timestamps available but not leveraged for relationship context

## 🏗️ **Target Architecture: "Contextual Intelligence Engine"**

### **Core Principles**

1. **Semantic Relationships**: Move beyond co-occurrence to meaningful, typed relationships
2. **Temporal Awareness**: Track relationship evolution and context over time
3. **Spatial Intelligence**: Map entities to locations and understand geographic context
4. **Domain Flexibility**: Universal relationship types that adapt to domain-specific needs
5. **Context Assembly**: Dynamic context generation from minimal user input
