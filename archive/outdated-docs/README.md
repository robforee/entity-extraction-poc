# Archived Documentation

**Archived on:** September 27, 2025  
**Reason:** Document consolidation to reduce confusion and focus on core evolution documents

## What Was Archived

### Fragmented Notes Series
- `notes.md` - `notes5.md` - Superseded by evolution series
- `notes-concept.md` - Concepts captured in evolution series
- `notes-context-tool.md` - Context tool thinking evolved
- `notes-entities.md` - Entity work documented in architecture
- `notes-gui.md` - GUI work obsolete given CLI-first approach

### Outdated Planning Documents
- `CONTEXT-RESTART.md` - Restart completed, captured in evolution
- `DEVELOPMENT-PLAN.md` - Plan evolved, captured in evolution-next
- `ENTITY-RELATIONSHIPS-PLAN.md` - Implemented, captured in architecture
- `INTEGRATION-PLAN.md` - Integration completed, captured in summary
- `WEEK1-COMPLETION-REPORT.md` - Historical, captured in evolution
- `WEEK2-COMPLETION-REPORT.md` - Historical, captured in evolution

### Outdated Specifications
- `ENTITY-TYPES.md` - Outdated given architectural changes
- `FEATURES.md` - Outdated given Smart Router architecture
- `TEST-RESULTS.md` - Historical test data
- `VISUALIZATION-SPEC.md` - Obsolete given CLI-first approach

## Current Active Documents

The following documents remain as the single source of truth:

- `IMPLEMENTATION-SUMMARY.md` - Current system status and achievements
- `notes-evolution.md` - The narrative journey and breakthroughs
- `notes-evolution-architecture.md` - Technical principles and patterns
- `notes-evolution-next.md` - Critical next steps and Smart Router architecture
- `README.md` - Main project README

## Key Learning Preserved

All critical insights from archived documents have been consolidated into the evolution series, including:
- Sep 27 Smart Router Architecture breakthrough
- Persistent conversation management system
- Outstanding question management CLI commands
- Context DB as conceptual source of truth + Source Systems for structured data
