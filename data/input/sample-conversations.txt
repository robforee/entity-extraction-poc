# Sample Construction Project Communications

## SMS Thread 1: Project Timeline Discussion
**Participants:** Rob (Owner), Mike (Contractor), Sarah (Architect)

Rob: Hey Mike, when can we start the foundation work? The permits came through yesterday.

Mike: Great news! I can start Monday if the weather holds. Need to coordinate with the concrete supplier first.

Sarah: Before you start, can we review the foundation plans one more time? I made some adjustments to the drainage system.

Rob: Sure, let's meet Friday at 2pm on site. Mike, does that work for you?

Mike: Perfect. I'll bring the updated timeline. We're looking at 3 weeks for foundation if everything goes smooth.

## Email Thread 1: Budget Discussion
**From:** rob@example.com
**To:** mike@contractor.com, sarah@architect.com
**Subject:** Budget Review - Kitchen Renovation

Hi team,

I've been reviewing the budget and we're about $15K over on the kitchen renovation. Here are the main overruns:

- Custom cabinets: $8,000 over budget
- Appliance upgrades: $5,000 over budget  
- Electrical work: $2,000 over budget

Can we discuss alternatives? I'm flexible on the appliances but really want to keep the custom cabinets.

Let me know your thoughts.

Rob
