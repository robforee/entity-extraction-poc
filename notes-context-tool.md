this tool is foremost a context generation tool for an agent to be able to locate terms related to a known corpus

if a user via agent searches for "network segmentation", valuable return would be people, materials, projects associated with that so that an agent could drill into various perspectives. what tools do I need and who do I need to talk to.

in a construction context, an agent gets a message "I bought more screws for John's deck" a search for John will return alist of johns, a list of projects, and be able to high conficance figure out what the project ID is and use that


if asked for information about microsoft defender
we want to see all the modules that suite of tools provides (products)
we want to be able to drill down into a product to see eg licensing plans and capabilities and various other categories I am unable to think of.
