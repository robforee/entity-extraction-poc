# Microsoft Defender Suite Exploration Guide

## Overview
This guide demonstrates how to explore Microsoft Defender suite of tools using the contextual intelligence system's queries and visualizations. The system leverages existing relationship types like `deployed_in`, `integrates_with`, `monitors`, `alerts_to`, and `manages` to map Defender components and their connections.

## Natural Language Queries (Phase 3 System)

### Discovery Queries
- "Show me all Microsoft Defender tools in our environment"
- "What Defender components are deployed in our network?"
- "List all Defender ATP and Defender for Office 365 instances"
- "Who manages our Defender suite?"
- "Where is Microsoft Defender for Endpoint deployed?"

### Relationship Exploration
- "What does Defender integrate with?"
- "Show me Defender monitoring relationships"
- "How do Defender alerts flow to SOC analysts?"
- "How are our Defender tools connected to SIEM systems?"
- "Show me the Defender suite architecture and dependencies"

### Operational Queries
- "Which SOC analysts work with Defender tools?"
- "What alerts do our Defender systems send and to whom?"
- "Who is responsible for Defender configuration?"
- "What infrastructure supports our Defender deployment?"

---

## API Exploration (Phase 4 System)

### REST Endpoints

**Get Defender-related entities:**
```bash
GET /api/entities?domain=cybersec&filter=defender
```

**Get relationship data:**
```bash
GET /api/relationships?domain=cybersec
```

**Contextual query:**
```bash
POST /api/query
{
  "query": "Show me Microsoft Defender deployment architecture",
  "currentProject": "Security Assessment",
  "currentLocation": "SOC Operations Center"
}
```

### Example API Usage
```javascript
// Discovery query
const result = await client.sendQuery(
  "Show me all Microsoft Defender tools in our environment", 
  {
    currentLocation: "SOC Operations Center",
    currentProject: "Defender Suite Analysis",
    executeActions: false
  }
);

// Get visualization data
const entitiesResponse = await fetch('http://localhost:3000/api/entities?domain=cybersec&limit=100');
const relationshipsResponse = await fetch('http://localhost:3000/api/relationships?domain=cybersec');
```

## Visualization Scenarios

### Network View
Shows Defender tools as nodes with relationship connections:

**Key Relationships:**
- `deployed_in`: Defender → Corporate Network
- `integrates_with`: Defender ↔ SIEM Systems
- `monitors`: Defender → Endpoints/Networks
- `alerts_to`: Defender → SOC Analysts
- `manages`: Security Engineer → Defender Configuration
- `uses`: SOC Analyst → Defender Tools

### Visualization Types

**1. Network Topology**
- Query: "Show me the network topology of our Defender deployment"
- Focus: Network connections and deployment locations
- Entities: microsoft_defender, network, endpoint
- Relationships: deployed_in, located_at, monitors

**2. Integration Map**
- Query: "Map all Defender integrations with other security tools"
- Focus: System integrations and data flows
- Relationships: integrates_with, deployed_in, monitors

**3. Alert Flow Diagram**
- Query: "Show the alert flow from Defender tools to SOC analysts"
- Focus: Alert routing and escalation paths
- Relationships: alerts_to, escalates_to, investigates

**4. Management Hierarchy**
- Query: "Display the management structure for Defender tools"
- Focus: Ownership and responsibility chains
- Relationships: manages, responsible_for, assigned_to

## System Capabilities

### Automatic Discovery
The system can automatically discover Defender relationships from:
- Configuration documents
- Network diagrams
- Incident reports
- Management assignments
- Integration documentation

### Context Resolution
When you ask about "Defender", the system can:
- Distinguish between different Defender products
- Resolve ambiguous references using context
- Provide location-specific information
- Maintain conversation context across queries

### Real-time Updates
Through the Phase 4 API:
- WebSocket connections for live updates
- Session management for conversation continuity
- Context-aware responses based on current location/project
- Progressive intelligence building through conversation
