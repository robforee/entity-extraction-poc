## Recommendations

### System Status

✅ **Smart Router is working correctly!**

The architectural breakthrough has been successfully implemented:
- Context DB serves as conceptual source of truth
- Smart Router discovers existing projects instead of creating new ones
- Universal Smart Interface Pattern (5 steps) is functioning
- Integration with Snappy is operational

### Next Steps

1. **Integration with ContextAssemblyEngine:** Connect Smart Router with existing contextual intelligence
2. **Production Deployment:** Deploy Smart Router to production environment
3. **Performance Optimization:** Optimize query processing and caching
