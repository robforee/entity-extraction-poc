## Test Summary

- **Total Tests:** 5
- **Passed:** 5
- **Failed:** 0
- **Overall Result:** ✅ SUCCESS

## Architectural Goal

Testing the Smart Router breakthrough from notes-evolution-next.md:
- **Problem:** Context System was creating NEW projects instead of finding EXISTING ones
- **Solution:** Smart Router that discovers existing data from Snappy instead of creating duplicates
- **Goal:** "I bought screws for John's deck" → Find existing John projects, don't create new ones

## Recommendations

### System Status

✅ **Smart Router is working correctly!**

The architectural breakthrough has been successfully implemented:
- Context DB serves as conceptual source of truth
- Smart Router discovers existing projects instead of creating new ones
- Universal Smart Interface Pattern (5 steps) is functioning
- Integration with Snappy is operational

### Next Steps

1. **Integration with ContextAssemblyEngine:** Connect Smart Router with existing contextual intelligence
2. **Production Deployment:** Deploy Smart Router to production environment
3. **Performance Optimization:** Optimize query processing and caching
